      <h3>Strawberry Perl</h3>
      <p>
      Strawberry Perl is a distribution of the Perl Programming language
      for the Microsoft Windows platform.  Additionally, strawberry contains
      a fully featured MinGW C/C++ compiler with many libraries included.
      While most other distributions rely on the user having software
      development tools already set up to install certain Perl components,
      Strawberry Perl ships with the most commonly used tools preconfigured
      and packaged.  It is a dramatic departure from other Perl distributions,
      and has influenced other distributions (such as its primary rival, the
      freely available but closed source Active Perl distribution, released
      by ActiveState) to provide such development tools in their own
      distribution.

      <h3>Raspberry Pi</h3>
      <p>
        The Raspberry Pi is a series of small single-board computers developed
        in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to promote the
        teaching of basic computer science in schools and in developing
        countries.  The original model became far more popular than anticipated,
        selling outside its target market for uses such as robotics. It does not
        include peripherals (such as keyboards, mice and cases). However, some
        accessories have been included in several official and unofficial bundles.
